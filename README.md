# YAO Bank
(Yet Another Online Bank)

Demo Application for Kubernetes suitable for showing authorization policy in centra

Consists of 3 microservices:

1. **database** - a single-cluster etcd database.  Stores the state for the demo.
1. **summary** - HTTP service that returns JSON account summaries.
1. **customer** - Front-end web service that displays account summaries to users.

The transaction and teller microservices are microservices that a bank teller would use to process deposits and withdrawals.  They don't feature in the policy demo directly, so have not been built yet.
